# External Code

This directory contains code from other scientists who have previously analyzed CATS and DTAG data.

## Purpose

Collecting existing analysis tools allows us to:
- Build on established methods
- Compare different approaches
- Properly attribute techniques to original authors

## Structure

Each external code contribution should be in its own subdirectory:

```
external_code/
├── author_year_description/
│   ├── README.md          # Attribution and description
│   ├── LICENSE           # Original license if available
│   └── code files...
```

## Adding Code

See `docs/CONTRIBUTING_EXTERNAL_CODE.md` for detailed guidelines on:
- How to add external code
- Attribution requirements
- License considerations
- Integration approaches

## Available Code

(List will be populated as code is added)
