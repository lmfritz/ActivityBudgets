What years exist? - 16 DTAG deployments: 2009-2010 - 72 CATS tag
deployments: 2016-2025

Where does the dataset currently live? DTAG data is still being located.
CATS tag data is on my drive, about to be consolidated today. There is a
working master spreadsheet in this repository titled
CATS_Tag_Deployments_By_Month_Year

Intended analysis for this chapter - Activity budgets - Behavioral state
classification - Time allocation by demohgraphic/season when and if
appropriate

February 19. 2026 Downloaded MATLAB update

February 20, 2026 Opened MATLAB to change
SimpleLungeDetectionBehaviorState.m code for my purposes. I created a
new file called SimpleBehaviorStateActivityBudget.m by cloning the
other, and am using ChatGPT to help me identify pieces of the code that
need to be editted to account now for four behavioral states instead of
just trying to identify foraging lunges. I also added MATLAB to the
github aka created a MATLAB project that is linked to my Activity Budget
github. It is saved on the Tag Data harddrive NAN_Backup.
